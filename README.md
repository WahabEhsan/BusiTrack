# BusiTrack

Our idea is to create an web application that will help business owners manage their businesses, which can also be managed through text. 
Many individuals prefer texting as the main type of communication, so we thought why not have an application that can also be managed through text. The owner is able to sign up and add their business through web app, then a message with the phone number to text to will respond to verify. The owner can either use the web app or if in a hurry can text commands. The web app will be able to take the businessâ€™s daily expenses and gains, and show the monthly or yearly profit/loss.

## Architecture

Following the MVC architecture, there are two views, a text message view, and a desktop view. The text message view will be the phone's text message interface. The desktop view will contain the web app in a browser. Each view will interact with our AWS web server via controllers and the web server interacts with the database via another controller.
